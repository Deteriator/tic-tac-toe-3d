#TIC TAC TOE 3D

My first Three.js game!

Design inspired by: [Karim Maaloul's 'Aviator' Animation](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/)


### Run it

Make sure you have node installed on your computer first. Then run this commands inside the project folder:

```
npm install
gulp
node app.js

```

Tips:

- Instead of "changes happen anywhere at anytime" You can then say "all requested changes pass into and are verified and executed through this one workflow function"
- So now a humble "click" doesn't change anything. It just tells update what it wants to change and update thinks about it and takes it from there.
